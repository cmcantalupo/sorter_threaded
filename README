A C++ library for doing a threaded sort.  

Brief description
-----------------

This library contains the class SorterThreaded which has a sort()
method that uses OpenMP threading.  This is a header only template 
library.  

SorterThreaded class
--------------------

Basic usage is with default options for the constructor.  The sort()
method takes an iterator to the beginning and end of the vector to be
sorted.

You optionally specify the maximum number of threads with the first
constructor argument.  The default for this option is -1 which will
use the OpenMP environment to determine the number of threads.  The
second optional constructor argument is the "taskFactor" which
determines how many threaded tasks the sort will be broken up into.
The number of tasks is taskFactor times the number of threads.  The
default for taskFactor is 8.

Compile options
---------------

If the STL sort on your system is thread safe then compile with
-DSTL_THREAD_SAFE to use the built in sort as the basic sort.
Otherwise a thread safe quick sort is implemented and will be used.
